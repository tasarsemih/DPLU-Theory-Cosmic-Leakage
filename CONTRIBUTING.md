# Contributing to DPLU Theory

First off, thank you for taking the time to explore the Dynamic Phase-Linked Universe (DPLU) model. Academic scrutiny and computational verification are essential for the evolution of this theory.

## How Can You Contribute?

### 1. Scientific Peer Review
We welcome feedback on the mathematical framework and the cosmic leakage constant ($\delta$). If you find inconsistencies or have suggestions for refining the integration with current $\Lambda$CDM data, please open a **Discussion**.

### 2. Simulation Enhancements
The current Qiskit simulation is a baseline. Contributions that improve the following are highly encouraged:
- More complex noise models (Amplitude damping, Depolarizing noise).
- Multi-qubit entanglement drift simulations.
- Integration with real quantum hardware provider backends (IBM Quantum, IonQ).

### 3. Data Correlation
If you have access to astrophysical datasets (JWST, LIGO, Gaia) that can be cross-referenced with the DPLU model, please submit an **Issue** with the relevant data points.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Branching Policy
- Please create a new branch for any feature or fix: `git checkout -b feature/refining-constant`.
- Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** for review.

### Intellectual Property & Commercial Use
- By contributing to this repository, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**.
- **Commercial Notice:** All commercial implementations of the DPLU-based algorithms or the $\delta$ constant remain the exclusive intellectual property of the author. Please contact the author for commercial licensing agreements before integrating this work into proprietary software.

## Code of Conduct
Please be respectful in discussions. This is a place for scientific inquiry and breakthrough engineering.
