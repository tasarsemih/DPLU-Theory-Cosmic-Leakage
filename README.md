## 🌌 Abstract

This repository hosts the mathematical framework, evidentiary data, and quantum computational simulations for the **Dynamic Phase-Linked Universe (DPLU)** theory. 

The core hypothesis posits that **Dark Matter** is not a particulate substance but a cumulative **"information leakage"** ($\delta \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-15}$) occurring during phase transitions between 3D temporal manifolds. This model provides a unified solution for the "Impossible Early Galaxy" problem identified by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and explains the micro-discrepancy in gravitational wave velocity.

## 🔬 Mathematical Foundation

The fundamental leakage constant ($\delta$) is defined as the deviation between gravitational wave velocity and the speed of light:
$$\delta = 1 - \frac{v_{gw}}{c} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-15}$$



As the universe undergoes approximately $3.3 \times 10^{15}$ cosmic cycles (phase transitions), this microscopic residue accumulates into the macroscopic gravitational scaffolding currently misinterpreted as Dark Matter particles.

## 💻 Quantum Simulation & Verification

The included Python script (`.ipynb`) utilizes the **Qiskit** framework to simulate the DPLU effect:
- **Simulation Logic:** Measures the cumulative phase drift on a qubit across $10^{12}$ to $10^{16}$ cycles.
- **Results:** Demonstrates that while leakage is negligible at laboratory scales, it creates significant decoherence (over 60%) at cosmic timescales, matching observed Dark Matter densities.
