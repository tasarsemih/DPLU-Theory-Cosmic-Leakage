# Security Policy and Intellectual Property Protection

## Supported Versions

This security policy applies to the following versions of the DPLU framework:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability or Theoretical Flaw

We take the integrity of the Dynamic Phase-Linked Universe (DPLU) model and its computational implementations seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the simulation code or a significant mathematical flaw in the theory, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Open a Public Issue:** To protect the intellectual property and the integrity of the research, please do not report vulnerabilities through public GitHub Issues.
2. **Private Disclosure:** Send a detailed report to **[Senin E-posta Adresin]**. 
3. **Response Time:** We acknowledge all valid reports within 48–72 hours and will work with you to analyze the findings.

## Intellectual Property (IP) and Commercial Security

The DPLU Theory and the associated $\delta = 1.5 \times 10^{-15}$ constant are the intellectual property of the author. 

- **Algorithmic Integrity:** Any attempt to reverse-engineer proprietary quantum error correction layers derived from this repository for commercial gain without a license is a violation of the Apache 2.0 terms and the author's IP rights.
- **Data Sensitivity:** Users are advised not to upload proprietary astronomical or quantum hardware datasets to this public repository.

## Bounty and Recognition

While we do not currently offer a financial bug bounty, significant theoretical corrections or security patches will be:
- Formally acknowledged in the `CONTRIBUTORS` section.
- Cited in future versions of the `theory_paper.pdf`.
- Prioritized for future commercial partnership discussions.
